# Eat-Durr-Burger

This app uses Handlebars, MySQL, Node, Express, and a homemade ORM to create a burger logger. I followed the MVC design pattern and Node to Query the route data for the app. Handlebars was used to generate all of my HTML.

# NPM Needed
 - body-parser
 - mysql
 - method-override
 - express
 - express-handlebars

## Instructions
1. Type a burger name into form to add burger into database .
    - Burger will be added to the "Burgers Available to Eat" section of the page.
2. Select a burger you would like to eat from the "Burgers Available to Eat List" and once selected it will be devoured .
    - Burger will be moved to the "Burgers That Have Been Devoured" section of the page.

## Node.JS instructions

- git clone or down the files from git
- npm init and install necessary packages
- type node server.js into console to run on local host
